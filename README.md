9. Debugging in VS Code:
   - Outline the steps to set up and start debugging a simple program in VS Code. What are some key debugging features available in VS Code? 
Debugging in Visual Studio Code
Debugging in Visual Studio Code (VS Code) allows developers to identify and fix errors in their code effectively. Here are the steps to set up and start debugging a simple program, along with key debugging features available in VS Code.

Setting Up and Starting Debugging
Step 1: Install a Debugger

Ensure that the necessary debugger for your programming language is installed. VS Code supports various debuggers for languages like JavaScript, Python, C++, etc.
Example: Install the "Debugger for Chrome" extension for debugging JavaScript applications running in the Chrome browser.
Screenshot (Installing Debugger):


Step 2: Configure Launch Settings

Open your project folder in VS Code.
Navigate to the Debug view by clicking on the bug icon in the Activity Bar, or press Ctrl + Shift + D.
Screenshot (Open Debug View):


Click on the gear icon (create a launch.json file) and select your environment (e.g., Node.js, Chrome).
Screenshot (Configure Launch Settings):


VS Code creates a launch.json file with default configurations. Edit this file to customize your debug environment if needed.
Step 3: Start Debugging

Place breakpoints in your code by clicking in the gutter next to the line number or pressing F9.
Press F5 or click Start Debugging to launch the debugger.
Screenshot (Start Debugging):


The debugger will start, and execution will pause at the first breakpoint encountered in your code.
Key Debugging Features in VS Code
Breakpoints: Set breakpoints to pause execution at specific lines of code for inspection.

Variables and Watch: View and monitor variables and expressions in real-time during debugging.

Call Stack: Navigate through the call stack to understand the flow of your program.

Debug Console: Interact with your application during debugging using the integrated debug console.

Step Controls: Step through your code (step into, step over, step out) to analyze behavior line by line.

Conditional Breakpoints: Set breakpoints that only trigger under certain conditions.

Exception Handling: Configure how VS Code handles exceptions thrown by your application.

Example of Debugging Session
Suppose you have a simple JavaScript file (app.js) with a function that adds two numbers. You set a breakpoint inside the function and start debugging. VS Code pauses execution at the breakpoint, allowing you to inspect variables and step through the code.
javascript
Copy code
// app.js
function addNumbers(a, b) {
    let sum = a + b; // Set breakpoint here
    return sum;
}

let result = addNumbers(5, 10);
console.log(result);
Summary
Visual Studio Code provides powerful debugging capabilities to help developers identify and fix issues in their code efficiently. By configuring launch settings, setting breakpoints, and utilizing key debugging features like variables, watch, and step controls, developers can debug their applications effectively directly within the editor.
